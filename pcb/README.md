# eagle cad files for 5 types of PCB

not the best naming convention but load them to see whats what

all of them have been sent off for manufacture at http://dirtypcbs.com and work

simple layout for easy hand soldering including everything in sockets

I switched convention on the IV25 and started callin gthem type 1 and type 3 to match teh IV26 tubes the PCB mask layer reflects that even if the PCB schematic does not

# Tubes ....

well they are getting harder to find but ebay is your friend, also use the 'international' .com site as I find the UK site sometimes hides possible sellers that will still ship to here and quote prices in dollers

# Components 

the main IC ... you can use that maxim part but its pricey or a perfect substitute is the 'HV5812' again ebay is the place to find those

WS2812b again ebay cheap and eay to find in reels ready to solder, that and 1 capacitor are surface mount (on the IV4/17 board) easy enough with a steady hand

the DC-DC module was again an ebay thing (can you spot a trend here!)  there are loads of far east manufactures doing a module that should be about Â£1 including post per module.  you could use one module to power more than 1 PCB with a fly-lead thats up to you, keeping 1 module per PCB means you can mix and match antyhting you want. 


# BIG SOLDER TIP

The hardest part can be threading the tubes and getting them all nice and level.

DO NOT use the glass envelope of the tube to try and align the digits, they vary quite a lot internally so allow a gap above the PCB on the first one you solder and alight the 'dots' or digits by eye or with a rule to get them even. If you dont allow a gap on the first one you might find you cant push subsequent ones down low enough ... 

At this point in construction I tended to tape everything down to a spare board as I went so that all the tubes were well aligned and I can fip it up and solder

KEEP YOUR FIRST EXAMPLE at least the first one you are happy with, then you can use it as a guide of height of dot/digit from the PCB for subsequent builds  (I use a scrap early PCB design that had an error but the tubes are neat so its a good guide).

you can adjust tubes a little once soldered but there is a risk you will break the pins or short something if you try and squash the tubes down. you cant really do more than a tiny twist on the IV4/17 tubes
